Hello there,

I am Jingwen Zhu now based in China. Hopefully I will move to the rest part of the world in the next 5 years(?).

I was a fresh graduate from the University of St Andrews until now I find this job as a college teacher in Software Development.

My main focuses are Software tech(e.g., java, python, swift) and IoT(at least, my goal is to get there :-P).

During free time, My hobbies are not different from most of the crowd. I play video games, do K-POP dancing and learn languages, even though I did it badly. I am obessessed with learning languages like Korean, Janpanese, English, Cantonese and French(Please note that I am only a beginner). It's very different from my self image because sometimes I look super introverted(My MBTI happens to be ESFP).

Anyway, I am thrilled to announced my personal blog is finally online! Shout out to [Not Pure Poole](https://github.com/vszhub/not-pure-poole) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).


All the best,

Jingwen
